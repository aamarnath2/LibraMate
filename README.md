# LibraMate

Created Libramate, an online book store, as a part of my CSCI201 course using the Google Books API.

Guests can search for books and access relevant information, including book ratings, publishing information, a list of authors, and a description of the book. Users who signup/login have access to added functionality, including the ability to follow other userse and add to two personal libraries: one for books that a user has read and one for a user's favorites.

Used Apache Tomcat as the server to host the program locally.
